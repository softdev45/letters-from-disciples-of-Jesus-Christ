All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture.
(JOH 10: 8-9)

REV 19 13: He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
JOH 17 3: Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
REV 3 18: I advise you to buy gold from me--gold that has been purified by fire. Then you will be rich.
And also buy white garments so you will not be shamed by your nakedness. And buy ointment for your eyes so you will be able to see.
JOH 6 63: The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.
JOH 15 3: Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

EXO 34 6-7
And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,
maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished;
he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”

GAL 5 22-23:
the fruit of the Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.

29 Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths,
but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.

JOH 3 16: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

>Dear resident of planet Earth,
>
>The following is a message to you from disciples and followers of Jesus Christ who worship God in Spirit and in Truth.
>Please, be willing to listen to it.
>It has been composed with hope that it will make clearer the view on the current situation of global affairs.
>To love one's neighbor has been commanded by God Almighty and Merciful
>        through The Lord, Jesus Christ - who is The Truth, The Way, The Life, The Light in The Darkness, The Gate to The Kingdom of Love,
>It has also been commanded by God to listen to Jesus Christ in whom God Almighty is Well Pleased.
>
>First and foremost, please, immediately, stop any violent invasion of any space where you are not welcome yet
>                                                and return your forces back to your territory to serve the interest of your people.
>In case you have done wrong, please, be willing to repent and to make up for the damage that has been done by your actions.
>			The sooner bloody violence is abandoned the lesser the damage cause by it to the population of world.
>			The rebuilding what has been damaged should start with the renewal of the mind and the heart
>			         - to be shaped after our Only Master - Jesus Christ - who was gentle and humble at heart
>												   and was seeking God's will with His mind, worshiping God in Spirit and Truth.
>
>			Please, never hesitate to ask for help - to love is to understand that help can be asked for.
>				We all are gifted with talents we are called to serve others with our abilities
>				    Humans cannot always be self-sufficient in face of unpleasant and difficult situation.
>
>		Looking around, witnessing blinding and fierce competition, may be discouraging.
>		All the destruction caused by the past wars - still echos nowadays.
>		Nations are remembering wars and genocides yet are they preaching the word of Truth and Love?
>		Are we giving Glory to God to whom it belongs?
>
>Obviously, it is not going to be easy, turning back from the path of distraction 
>    (on which are those who are not gathering in the name of The Truth - Jesus Christ).
>It is not easy to turn away from the path of war after participating in it or initiating it.
>War is falsely meant to make nations richer and more powerful. Let's remember, our enemy is any spirit that is not Holy - not a human being who is often unaware.
>Many had become ashamed to love Jesus, to love God, to love brothers and sisters in Christ
>- as if it was a sign of weakness to love one's neighbour or ask for help or express love for Jesus.
>
>>REV 3 19: 'Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.'
>
>What is love?
>It has been written by Spirit of Truth that God is Love.
>
>Why is Love not being advertised while weapons are being produces and sold?
>Many nations were fooled to think that other nations are enemies - while the enemy is invisible - because evil spirits and invisible to human eye.
>Enemy is the accuser of brothers and sisters.
>God wants us, tribes and nations of the earth, to prosper, and He gave us the The Holy Word - to help us through the times of darkness.
>Let's not be deluded by riches of this world.
>
>Many humans turned away from The Truth, from Jesus Christ,
>    from the Way of Life in Truth that leads to eternal life in the kingdom of Love,
>because of the schemes of the Evil to damage the reputation of Church of Jesus Christ
>    and turn people away from the Holy Word of God: The Good News,
>
>It was Jesus who was hated by the World because he testified that works of this world are evil.
>    He was hated for no good reason. Hatered towards Jesus comes from misunderstanding of His Word and from evil spirits.
>
>Yet His word survived, by the Grace of God Almighty,
>    despite the prosecutions and all the terible things,
>    that during the centuries were done by rulers of this world and later were attributed to His church.
>
>Yet it was all prophesied in scripture by the Holy Spirit that many will be deceived; and is also described in the Vision of Revelation of Jesus Christ.
>God Almighty and Merciful so loved the world that he sent His Only Begotten Son to bring us Good News, that there is life after death of the flesh.
>
>That good news is that Jesus was resurrected and ascended into heavens and sins are remitted in His name.
>This good news can be shared, what is more it has been proclaimed as The Truth.
>Blessed is those who are not offended by Jesus Christ and His Good News.
>That blessing is to be given to all those who repent, believe in Jesus Christ, become His disciples and remain faithful.
>They who persevere will also receive the Holy Spirit of Truth.
>
>Jesus Christ the Son of God Almighty was with God from the foundations of the world and witnessed the world being created.
>He was sent to save us and to become a spring of living water,
>    giving us the commands He was given by Generous God,
>    giving us Eternal Word - The Word that will never pass nor become outdated.
>
>>JHN 4:14
>>"whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again.
>>In fact, the water I will give him will become a well of water springing up in him for eternal life."
>
>Let's look at the world
>- so many areas can be reevaluated, restructed and rebuilt
>- there is enough food produced in the world to feed everyone
>	- yet we are throwing one third (1/3) of it away - greedily
>	- Is it because seems better than to share it with someone we don't consider our friend?
>	- and in this manner we are not helping those in need, indeed, creating division where a bridge could have been built.
>God says:
>>EXO 23 11: but during the seventh year let the land lie unplowed and unused.
>>Then the poor among your people may get food from it, and the wild animals may eat what they leave.
>>Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
>
>Many societies of the world - even though rich, and highly educated - are blind,
>	not helping others and not helping themselves by ignoring those who are needy and refusing possible cooperation which requires trust.
>
>Often, development works of all kind,
>whether it is construction of buildings,
>living areas or techonolgy products
>are not given enough thought,
>    since the focus of those ventures is primarly on profit - financial gain
>    - and not on building things that will last for generations.
>
>Therefore, cities are flooded with pulltion: not only fumes but noise too.
>
>Floods and other natural disaster are causing a lot of damage
>    because simple fact that trees help hold water in the soil is not taken into account.
>
>This is simply because to take into account the opition of experts from all fields
>takes time and also leads to increasing cost of investment which are usually profit-centered and not quality-centered.
>
>Investors and businesses are not willing to share profit equally with all parts of society,
>    digging graves for future generations and ivestments themselves.
>
>The answer to that is simple: we should all live by the word of God
>    - it is He, The God Almighty who gives the icrease.
>
>Also sharing knowledge and developing ideas is difficult in this human world,
>    because it protects the rights to inventions for various reasons:
>- one being the fact that nations and organizations are in competition or conflict with each other.
>There is sensation of lack of trust between organizations.
>Do we trust that after helping others they will not leave us behind helpless.
>Helping others does not have to having less.
>Why do humans prefer luxuries then helping those who are pooerer?
>Simply, because humans are short-sighted - they do not care for generations to come,
>    that's why they need to become children of God Almighty who reigns over the ages.
>
>Here's an encouragement to those who lead, those who are strong:
>Have courage to believe in The Truth - Jesus Christ, and remain in His Word and in His Peace he gave to his disciples.
>Become student of the word of God and give good example to others.
>
>The benefit coming from inventions is not shared with whole civilization.
>Ideas are often kept secret to bring profit.
>This results in creation of lobbies (groups of people seeking to influence legislators on particular issues)
>this suffocates development,
>equal rights,
>and leads to absurd laws like introducing restrictions on size and shape of fruits and vegetables,
>not taking into account the fact that particular weather conditions may influence those parameters
>yet it does not change the nutritional value of product.
>
>What is more, people are made to believe absurd things
>about shapes and skin-colors of fruit (skin is meant to protect the fruit)
>which leads to manufacturing plants that look nice and can stored for longer on the shelf,
>    regardless of chemical composition and nutritional value.
>
>Humans are sometimes more concerned with trivial things
>and than they become more important than the truth that is being hidden
>for the sake of profit and outward appearence.
>
>Because forgivness is not being practiced,
>and competeing parties are happy with downfall of their opponents,
>and humans rather keep silent
>	to not undermine someone else's undertaking and reputation
>		by letting the truth about questionable practices out.
>	Also for fear of being prosecuted by those who make profit in dirty ways.
>		Let's remember, that it is the evil spirit, who is afraid and does not believe in forgivness.
>			Therefore only after whole human race receives Jesus Christ and The Truth there will be opportunity to fix those issues.
>
>As a result of evil works, the mind of human collective is emaciated.
>Humans feel endangered, thinking they need to fight for survival,
>they do not benefit fully from possible cooperatives.
>
>They become insensitive to others and in return to themselves,
>to strangers and to loved ones.
>Because the eternal law says:
>You will love your neighbour as you love yourself.
>You cannot disregard your neighbour without disregarding yourself and your loved ones.
>Sooner or later consequences will backfire.
>The God who created this word shows no partiality because he loves all,
>because He is Love; and He hates sin because He is perfect and wants us to be perfect.
>And sin leads His creation towrds death.
>
>If humans disrespect The Law and The Truth he has created this world with,
>    it is equal to disrespecting Love that God is.
>
>Let's put on the armor of faith and God's love
>and let's start thinking in the truly sustainable way
>by making Jesus Christ the head of all goverments, nations, tribes and families.
>That is making His Words the Root of all human edeavours.
>
>God's command regarding Jesus Christ is astonishingly simple:
>"This is my Son beloved in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him"
>
>Jesus came to baptize humans with the Holy Spirit.
>His words are living water and bread of eternal life.
>His words transform into child of God - that is why they offend humans.
>
>All humans have to do is to listen to words of Jesus Christ,
>as if their life depended on it,
>start learning them by heart,
>and remaining in them.
>
>Let's make Word of Jesus Christ the hottest topic ever and forever.
>In New Heavenly Jerusalem that comes down from God, Jesus Christ is the Lamp and God Almighty in the temple.
>Let's make Jesus the Lamp of The Earth too.
>
>God did make it simple: Just listen.
>And Jesus completes it by saying:
>if you truly are my disciples you will remain in my word.
>
>His words are beautiful and simple:
>both adults and children can uderstand it.
>There is no lie and no deceit in them.
>
>Jesus was without sin,
>the blameless lamb of God,
>The embodiment of God Who is Love.
>His Word, the word of Holy Spirit was written down by His disciples
>	under influence of The Holy Sprit of Truth after Jesus ascended into Heaven.
>He was not concerned with writting it down Himself,
>    he knew that Holy Spirit will guide His disciples,
>    because God Almighty who reigns over the ages told Him that it would happen.
>
>We have four written accounts of His ministry
>and no fault can be found in them, even after in-depth study,
>Those four accounts may differ in some details, because they present the Truth from different viewpoint.
>Yet they do not contradict each other.
>
>We have revelation of Jesus Christ which summarises the whole Scripture
>and delivers the confirmation that indeed:
>Jesus sits at the right hand side of The One Who Created The Universe
>and will come, only God knows when, to judge the living and the dead.
>Righteous will rise to eternal life and unrighteous for judgment.
>JOH 5 24: "I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.
>
>All His words are timeless,
>they are the Truth, the Law of Love and Mercy,
>pattern that describes life on earth and in universe,
>    and life in eternity after resurrection.
>
>The practical implementation of the change
>towards The Truth is therefore as simple as
>"Listen to Jesus Christ, the beloved son of God Almighty, in Whom He is well pleased".
>
>Remember what Jesus said to His disciples: be wise as snakes and as innocent as doves.
>
>As humans we are wolves to each other,
>yet as Children of God we are friends,
>brothers, sisters and mothers who feed each other with Good News.
>
>Jesus said: “I am sending you out like sheep among wolves.
>Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves."
>
>Let's be aware of that and be honest and gentle to one another on the way to God Almighty and Merciful.
>
>Remember as children of God we are no longer wolves to each other:
>If we help someone from another tribe
>we are helping the whole kingdom by giving good example
>of leaving behind human ways and doing God's will.
>
>It will not be easy to succeed in achieving the ideal of Jesus Christ,
>yet remember that He had patience with his disciples,
>and stayed faithful until the end,
>until his martyr's death on the cross,
>and before dying He forgave those who prosecuted Him.
>(for they knew not what they were doing - killing the only begotten son of God)
>
>Also, one account says that Jesus said on the cross:
>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”.
>Which can indicate that he did for a moment before dying
>thought that God had abandoned Him,
>and let Him who was blameless die miserable death of a sinner.
>That is confirming that He was here in human flesh
>and suffered like a human being,
>before He was resurrected and ascended into Heavens.
>
>God did let Him suffer and did let him doubt,
>yet Jesus never failed in His ministry
>fullfilling all the prophecies about the Messiah,
>and fullfilling God's Law with Love and Mercy.
>
>His truly was the Son Of God, who faithfully served the Almighty by doing God's will.
>and He passed His teachings to those he chose as His disciples.
>
>It was difficult for His disciples to comprehand His teachings,
>and it wasn't until after His ascension into heavens
>that The Holy Spirit was sent to fill His disciples.
>Jesus, who was the Blameless lamb,
>who came to baptize us with fire and the Holy Spirit,
>did have hard times here on earth
>and not many poeple at the time of His ministry could even listen to His teachings.
>
>At one occasion he expressed this saying:
>“You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?"
>
>Every word that He said is the most precious gem; like He who is One with God is:
> The Lord said through Holy Spirit:
> “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation;
> the one who relies on it will never hurry nor worry."
>(ISA 28 16)
>
>Let's us all, who follow Jesus Christ remember,
>that we should not be ignorant like we are when we hurry to meet the demands of this world.
>Many humans are in constant hurry and struggle to complete received tasks.
>The demands of this world make us hurry because humans do not cooperate and are wolves to each other.
>Humans were thought to expect rewards for being fitter, running faster, being smarter.
>This thinking is far from truly intelligent way of being.
>Disciples of Jesus are to remain in the Peace He gaves us.
>
>One may run, of course, if one likes running, yet why not remain in peace and sober-minded while running.
>There are better things than runners high.
>It has been reported that in the ancient times, wars were being stopped during the olympics.
>Could it be the indicator that civilization has not moved forward despite technological advancement.
>
>As long as the word of God who is Holy, who is Love, is not respected and loved,
>    humans will remain humans and wolves to each other.
>
>Because when the King of Kings will return everyone will be serving God who loves all His children.
>So, truly, Jesus Christ is The Living Water, and The Bread of Eternal Life.
>Truly Jesus Christ is The Son Of Living God and is One with Him who created the universe.
>Jesus Christ is The Truth, The Way, The Life: He is The True Way of Life.
>
>Let's not be ashamed of Jesus Christ being our Savior, The Only Master and Teacher.
>Let's not be ashamed to preach the word anywhere we go and do good deeds that glorify God.
>Let's not attribute wonderful inventions of technology to humans who do good things by God's Grace.
>Let's remind each other that The Power, The Glory, and The Kingdom belongs To God Almighty who has His throne in heavens, and Earth is His footstool.
>Let's always give thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God Almighty who is our Ideal, as Holy Spirit recommends through Paul, the Apostle.
>
>Unless humans follow the only master and teacher Jesus Christ,
>    they will remain in their blindness and keep on warring with each other
>    to their own and their children's detriment.
>Because the wrath of God remains to 3rd and 4th generations on those who hate him.
>
>Yet his love lasts thousand generations.
>As it is written in the scripture:
>Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments.
>But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction;
>he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.
>(DEU 7)
>“The LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,
>maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin.
>Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished;
>he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”
>
>Considering the above, to disregard the Word of God it is ignorant of every parent who cares for ones children.
>
>So let's encourage each other to be faithful to God,
>    so that humans can be healed of their blindness by becoming God's children.
>It will be for the benefit of the whole human race
>    who currently is fighting because it cannot properly manage the resources tha are available.
>
>Once the resources to sustain comforable living are running low,
>    humans start looking for dirty ways to earn and continue being wolves to each other,
>    while others keep luxury to themselves.
>
>The reason of this blindness is the lack of the Word of God in our daily life.
>Blessed are those who are not offended by Jesus Christ who is The Word of Living God.
>Nations and societies where the Word Of Living God, Jesus Christ
>    is not the beginning and the end of every important meeting are not receiving free blessings.
>When there is no time for the Word Of God there is no time for Love.
>
>Blessed are those who are not offended by Jesus Christ: The Word of God.
>Reading word of Jesus can be compared to undergoing refinement in God's Fire.
>His Word is the Sword of The Spirit which cleanses cutting out what was planted by evil spirits.
>
>Being children of God who is Perfect and followers of Christ
>    we are all called to be ideal,
>    like our heavenly father is ideal.
>
>Currently the world of business is suffering because of
>    countless and absurd laws that were imposed long ago and are often outdated and rarely updated.
>It suffers because of pressure to perform well among competing parties.
>
>Because the whole planet is competing for resources to survive,
>those who manage organizations have to deal with pressure:
>pressure of making decisions for the whole collective of a company,
>pressure of making decisions how to distribute resources,
>pressure to please the investors who await profitable actions
>	and clients who await best possible service.
>Making mistake may possibly result in giving advantge to competition.
>Thinking under such high pressure makes people unable to think clearly.
>Many laws that are imposed by governments are quickly becoming obsolete considering rapidly progressing changes.
>
>Workers who could help with their experise
>are either
>in rebellious groups protesting against huge corporations,
>or
>somewhere below the top of the ladder,
>and never hear about decisions being made on the top,
>and even if they were given a chance,
>giving good ideas where bright people are favored and pushed upwards in the hierarchy
>may be perceived as dangerous by those who have worked hard to get higher
>	and are not always eager to bring to the table ideas of those
>		who are lower because that could mean there is someone better for their position.
>That was just one example how profit-centered organisations
>    who favor those who brought more profit in the past as more valuable workers
>    are not able to perform well in all kinds of scenarios.
>
>The approach that would be in accordance with
>    teachings of Jesus Christ is that
>good ideas are not inventions of humans,
>but result of collective work of the body of Christ and a Gift From God Generous and Almighty who loves all His children.
>
>Only God is Good, Jesus teaches, therefore all that is good comes from Him who loves all His children and shows no favorism.
>Holy Spirit writes:
>JAM 1 17: Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
>JAM 3:
>13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
>14 But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.
>15 Such "wisdom" does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, of the devil.
>16 For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.
>17 But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
>18 Peacemakers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness.
>
>Therefore, humans, forgetting about God,
>    because of the schemes of the evil one,
>    think that it is their own achievements that pull development of civilization forward.
>That is not true: it is God who gives all that is good,
>    and without His presence,
>    without praise given to Him and His son Jesus Christ,
>    even brightest inventions cannot be properly applied to benefit the whole society of the earth.
>
>Obviously, it is hard to blame anyone in particular for the situation.
>It is has happened before, more than 2000 years ago.
>God has already showed us what happens to humans
>    when they are subject to harsh regulations of Law
>    without fullfillment through Love and Mercy that came with our lord Jesus Christ, who is The Truth.
>
>The history of nation chosen by God is well documented in Old Testament.
>The only thing that can save the world in its entangled condition is Jesus Christ:
>    The Truth, Love and Mercy.
>We should not blame nor judge anyone for the current state of world affairs
>    because there would be not end to it.
>There is another way, the only way:
>    If we all accept Jesus as The True Way of Life,
>    the abundance of Love will flow,
>    and humans will become children of God, and friends in Truth and Love.
>
>Let's trust in Jesus and The Holy Spirit will help us sort everything out
>    and bring order into the chaotic scene of world affairs.
>Evrything is possible with God Almighty, Merciful, Ideal and Generous.
>Let's encourage ourselves to love Jesus Christ.
>
>Currently there are many lies circulating in the air:
>    one lie is that if you do not practice the profession you were trained to do you will drop out and become useless.
>    That is lie, possibly started when people were seduced by evil spirits

>
>Another lie is that you cannot learn anything new once you reach certain age.
>For God nothing is impossible.
>Yet for humans under influence of fear and greed
>    not much is possible except to copy the behaviour of previous generations and other people.
>Unless humanity attains the Godly level of peace:

>
>Another reason why some may be offended by Jesus Christ

>			No one can tell you what is the right way to pray better than Jesus Christ.
>			Also, you are not to criticize the way other pray behind closed door.

>Knowledge of the Word of God is helpful to be in readiness to receive the Holy Spirit.
>There are mentions of it in the holy scripture: for example: when Mother of Jesus was about to concive through the Holy Spirit.
>LUK 1:35 “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.

>
>Followers of Jesus live their life
>    centered around the Only Master and Teacher: Jesus,
>    and important part of His live

>
>Those sufferings and pains, however, are rewarded
>    with full joy and peace of Christ:
>Jesus while carrying the cross, after being flogged with a whip,
>    he was still able to correct crying women that it is not He they should be crying for.
>
>LuK 23:27
>A large crowd followed Jesus. Some of the women were sad and crying.
>They felt sorry for him. But Jesus turned and said to the women,
>“Women of Jerusalem, don’t cry for me. Cry for yourselves and for your children too.
>The time is coming when people will say,
>‘The women who cannot have babies are the ones God has blessed.

>Some might think or say that humans love to war and it is inborn in their nature.

>You do not fight to kill another human being but to show them The Greatness of God Almighty who is Love.
>You fight with good deeds and serve with the help of the spirit of Truth, who is Helping and Comforting Spirit.
>You share the Truth you've learned.
>You notice your mistakes.
>You are aware that evil spirit can tempt even those who work under influence of Holy Spirit;

>Jesus used words from The Scripture to defend from the attacks of the Devil.
>You share good news in the Holy Spirit with help of God's servants: angels and saints - who are in the Army of God.
>You remember that only God is Good,

>You are willing to die for Jesus Christ,

>Evil spirits, which followers of Jesus are fighting against,

>Whoever insults his brother or sister, will be subject to the court. Whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to hellfire.
>
>Then, in a letter to Corinthians, Paul, the apostle of Christ uses this word, adding however: "I don’t speak as the Lord would".

>The rulers and leaders should be respected and loved too - not feared.

>ISA 66
>1 This is what the LORD says: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.

>
>- remember that we are created in God's image: we "create" this world also with the words out of our mouths and with our hands-
>- suppose - for the sake of thought exercise that: - after you have been resurrected to eternal life with God and Christ and all God's servants
>- you are given power - to create universe, sustain it, and observe it -
>- if that is too much - let's say you, as an eternal spirit - are given the power over one earth-like planet
>
>- the question is: would you reveal yourself completely to those whom you have created? -
>- would it not spoil the whole plan of creation of the world filled with beings created in your image (yet mortal and faulty)?
>- also, let's add that you would have the power to take souls into eternity -
>- remember that God is Almighty, Jealous, and hates Sin (sin leads to destruction of His creation)
>- he created us in His image and He has the power to take us out of this world into eternity where He - The Alimighty Spirit of Love - exists
>- once you take all those things into consideration - the plan to save those who believe is Jesus Christ,
